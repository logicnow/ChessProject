# N-able Technical Exercise - ChessProject

Welcome to the technical exercise used to assess candidates for Developer roles at N-able.

You can carry out this exercise in your own time, in your IDE of choice.

This project will give you a chance to demonstrate your skills in a variety of different methodologies.
Some of the things we think are important:
* Clean Code
* Unit Tests/Test-driven Development (TDD)
* Design patterns
* Refactoring

__STEPS__  
1. Fork the repository into your own github account   
2. Choose which language you are most comfortable completing this in - you have a choice of PHP, Java, C#  
3. Read the documentation for the project and follow the instructions  
4. Commit updated code to your repo for the project
5. Create a pull request with your changes against our master branch
6. Pass the pull request URL back to our recruitment team

Timescales - as a rough guide please aim to get this back to us within 1 week of starting the project, but we do understand that life gets in the way sometimes!

__Any questions please get in touch with Grant in the recruitment team - [grant.meldrum@n-able.com](mailto:grant.meldrum@n-able.com?subject=Developer%20ChessProject)__
